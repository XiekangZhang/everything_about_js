# Vue.js
This sub-project is about learning one javascript framework - _vue.js_, which is a progressive framework. 
The idea of progressive is that you are starting with something small and gradually building something bigger.
The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or
existing projects. On the other hand, _Vue_ is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications.

The sources used in this sub-project are:
- [office documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)

Currently there are two versions of vue supported. There are _vue 2_ and _vue 3_. We will start with _vue 2_, 
due to current development situation about a framework of vue, called _vuetify_. 

# Installation
- Install _node js_
- Install _vue2_ : _npm install vue2_ or _npm install latest vue_ for _vue 3_
- Install _vue cli_: _npm install -g @vue/cli_ --> sometimes you need _sudo_ right
  - _vue --version_ 
  - _npm update -g @vue/cli_
- Then create _vue_ project: _vue create project_name_
