HT: Hypertext --> break free of a single page and link to other pages.
ML: Markup-language --> describe the structure of web pages.

## some useful elements

- \<q> --> short quote "
- \<blockquote> --> longer quotes
- block elements vs inline elements vs void elements
- a domain name: a unique name that is used to locate your site. --> website without www

![url structure](images/url.png)

- using # to access id attribute
- JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

### \<a>

- using the id attribute to create a destination for \<a>
- using target="\_blank" attribute in \<a> to open the website into new window

### \<img>

- Images are stored on web servers right alongside HTML pages, so every image on the Web has its own URL, just like web pages do.
- using alt attribute in \<img> to indicate information of one used image if the image can't be loaded.
- adding width and height attributes into \<img> element to define the size of image
