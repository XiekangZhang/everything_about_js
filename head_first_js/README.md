# Getting functional

## pass-by-value & pass-by-reference

- pass-by-value: the value of a variable is passed to a function/method.
- pass-by-refrence: a refrence to that variable is passed to the function, which gives a way to change the contents of the variable
- JavaScript is pass-by-value (pass-by-copy)

## The short lives of variables

- GLOBALS live as long as the page. A global variable begins life when its JavaScript is loaded into the page.
- LOCAL variables typically disappear when your function ends.

## JavaScript objects

- JavaScript objects are just a collection of properties.

## Getting to know the DOM

- DOM stands for document object model --> interacting with your web page
